# Trax
Scenery file editor for MaSzyna (Polish train simulator)

---

> Targeted to fully cover all post-production of MaSzyna sceneries and missions.
With 1.0 you'll be able to create new missions,
automatically fix some common bugs and manually - fix everything.
I needed a tool which makes editing scn files easy, fast and effective.
For now numerous tools are needed for this, of which none is perfect,
the process is tedious and error-prone.
ScnEdit aims to shorten mission design time from months to days, and fixing the bugs from days to hours.
Minutes actually.

Since I like trains, I'm not OK with the time it takes to create new sceneries and missions.
I'm far from being OK with the time it takes to fix bugs in existing ones or the time needed
to add some simple things like timetables.
That's where ScnEdits comes in. It will make simple things simple, and the development process less tedious.
